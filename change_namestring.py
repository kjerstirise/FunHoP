hsa:x = IDs created by KEGG for all genes in the KEGG database. 

The stringfixer code is the first code file of FunHoP. 
Consists of three functions: string_list, string_changer, and ortholog_remover. 
Alters the namestrings for each child in the XML files to include the names for all the genes that are found within the child. 
This is neccessary in order to create the gene nodes, as the gene name strings only contains the name of the first hsa:x, followed 
by paralog names for other species.
